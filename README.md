# Whiteboard-Application-Using-Machine-Learning-Model

The Whiteboard Application Using OpenCV is a digital platform designed to replicate the functionality of traditional physical whiteboards while harnessing the capabilities of computer vision technology. This application allows users to draw, write, and collaborate in a digital space, enhancing remote communication, creative expression, and interactive learning experiences. The application supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to engage in synchronous drawing and annotation on a shared canvas. The integration of collaborative features promotes remote teamwork, virtual brainstorming, and interactive educational sessions. The application includes an undo/redo functionality that maintains a history of actions, enabling users to correct mistakes or explore different design iterations without limitations. The user interface (UI)is designed for ease of use and efficient navigation. The intuitive interface ensures that users, regardless of their technical proficiency, can seamlessly access and employ the applicationâ€™s features.
